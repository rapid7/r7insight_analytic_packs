Analytic Packs

What is a Pack?
---------------
A Pack is a pre-configured set of Tags, real-time Alerts, and Dashboards built for you, based on common log management and analysis use cases from our Community. The JSON-based Packs are ready for immediate download and usage in your Logentries account.

How do I add a Pack to my InsightOps account?
---------------------------------------------
It's easy. If you're already logged into your InsightOps account, click "Analytic Packs" from the left hand navigation and follow the instructions to use the Add a Pack wizard

What if I don't see a Category I need?
--------------------------------------
We are always looking to improve our Packs and add new ones where needed. Let us know what you would want to see by emailing InsightOpsTeam@rapid7.com
